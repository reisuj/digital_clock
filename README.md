# digital_clock
This is a digital clock that I have been working on for  myself and co-workers. We get 15 minutes breaks and a 1 hour lunch so I've 
set those as buttons to start a countdown with a message box to notify when time is up.

I may update at a later time with an options menu in which they can put the times they go to break and lunch to get reminders before it is
time as well.
